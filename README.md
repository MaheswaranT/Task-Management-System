A simple console-based Task Management System implemented in Python. This project allows users to add, view, update, delete, and mark tasks as completed. Tasks are saved to a file for persistence.

## Features

- Add new tasks with a title, description, due date, and priority.
- View all tasks with their details.
- Update existing tasks.
- Delete tasks.
- Mark tasks as completed.
- Persistent storage of tasks using a text file.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

    cd task-management-system
    ```

3. Run the script:
